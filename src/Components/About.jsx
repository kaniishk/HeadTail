            In contrast to a landing page, your About Us page is the ideal place to accommodate a number of objectives:<br></br><br></br>
            <ul>
                <li>Communicate the story of your business and why you started it.</li><br></br>
                <li>Describe the customers or the cause that your business serves.</li><br></br>
                <li>Explain your business model or how your products are made.</li><br></br>
                <li>Put a face to your business, featuring the founders or the people on your team.</li><br></br>
                <li>In short, your About Us page is a home for your founding story, a place to show off your business wins, and a sales page that answers the most pressing question new customers have about your business outside why they should buy its products:</li><br></br>
                <b>Why should they buy from you?</b>
            </ul>
